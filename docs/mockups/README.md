# UI mockups

Standalone, self-contained HTML mockups for proposed UI changes &mdash; not part of
the running app, just click-through prototypes for review. Open one directly in a
browser.

- **search-tab-consolidation.html** &mdash; groups the **Search by Name**, **SKU
  Lookup**, and **Scan UPC** tabs under one new **Search** tab, cutting the form
  panel's top-level tab row from five tabs to three. Every top-level tab (Manual
  Entry, Import from Website, Search) now opens with the same two dropdowns:
  **Type** (Shelf Talker / Small Display / Large Display) and **Product Type**
  (Wine / Spirits / Beer), replacing the old Shelf Talkers/Display Signs +
  Large/Small toggle buttons and the Wine/Spirits/Beer pill toggle. Both are
  wired as shared state across tabs. Inside Search, a method chooser (Search by
  Name / SKU Lookup / Scan UPC) sits below Type/Product Type, styled as the same
  pill-button group used elsewhere in the form.
- **food-pairing-suggestions.html** &mdash; proposes an optional **Food Pairing
  Suggestions** block on Wine / Spirits talkers: up to 3 small icon+word pairings
  (e.g. "🥩 Grilled Steak") printed between the description and the price block.
  Pairings come from a small ordered list of varietal &rarr; pairings rules,
  matched by keyword against the Product Title/Description &mdash; the same
  pattern `public/js/card.js` already uses for `BEER_STYLE_COLORS`, just applied
  to wine varietals. Staff can accept the suggested pairings, toggle individual
  ones on/off, add a custom pairing, or hide the block entirely per talker. Try
  the sample wines in the left panel to see detection run against the rule list
  shown in the right panel; the live card preview in the center reuses the real
  card's proportions/fonts/logo so the new block can be judged in context.
- **wine-pairings-experimental-toggle.html** &mdash; follow-up to
  food-pairing-suggestions.html above: scopes that same feature behind a new
  **Wine Food Pairings** toggle switch under Settings &rarr; **Experimental
  Features** (targets the `2.6` branch, which already has that section, currently
  empty). Off by default &mdash; while off, the Edit Talker form, the card's
  "Pairs Well With" block, and the Pairing Rules panel are all absent, not just
  disabled. Flip the switch in the Settings modal (open by default) to see all
  three appear live, and back off to confirm nothing is left behind. Also
  introduces this app's first on/off switch component (`.switch`), since
  Settings today only has the toggle-btn pill-pair pattern (Change Theme, Menu
  Bar Size) &mdash; not the right shape for a single boolean feature flag.
- **best-buy-badge.html** &mdash; a new graphic **Best Buy** badge for Shelf
  Talkers and Display Signs, marking a staff-picked value on the talker/sign
  itself rather than only in the free-text Awards or Other Ratings field.
  Three interchangeable styles &mdash; **Seal Medallion** (recommended, a
  circular award seal with ribbon tails), **Starburst** (the same jagged-burst
  treatment as the existing CLOSEOUT!! badge, as a graphic seal), and **Corner
  Ribbon** (a diagonal banner flush with the corner) &mdash; toggle on/off and
  switch live in the preview, on both a Full Size Shelf Talker card and a
  Large Display Sign. Kept as its own on/off toggle rather than a fifth
  Talker Style option, since Best Buy describes the product, not the price,
  and should combine with Closeout/Chilled/Super Sale rather than replace
  them. Switch the sample product to Beer to see the one real wrinkle: Beer
  talkers already print a state-of-origin badge and a country flag in the top
  corners, so Seal/Starburst stack underneath whichever corner is already
  taken (Ribbon isn't offered there, since it claims the whole corner).
